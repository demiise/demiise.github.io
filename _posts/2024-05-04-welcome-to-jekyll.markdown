Hello, World! How the devil are you?

So, this is the first post in what I am considering the start of my coding journey. I have "dabbled" with code in the past, mostly from a scripting perspective as a Windows Administrator. A bit of batch here, some Powershell there... along with the obligatory Basic back in the days of the Commordore 64. 

{% highlight basic %}
10 PRINT "Poop!"
20 GOTO 10
RUN
{% endhighlight %}


So yes, that's probably about as far as my knowledge really goes. I've always liked the idea of coding, but just never had the dedication to properly sit down and learn. I blame what I am recently learning could be ADHD... but that's another story! 
Back on track: Finding myself in a position with a bit more free time, and a desire to make some changes in my life I figured there is no better time to learn a new skill. Being an Apple user, it made sense for me to jump onto the Swift train, with the intention of being able to create my own apps for the Apple ecosystem. Primarily to create some projects for myself, and see where things go. I honestly have no expectations and no plans other than to learn and have some fun.

What I have learned already, is that looking for resource online is a minefield. There is just so much out there, and trying to weed through to find something that appealed to me, and was upto date enough was downright confusing as a beginner!
After looking at a few options, I finally settled upon [Swiftful Thinking](https://www.swiftful-thinking.com). Mostly because his own journey appealed to me, the content looked up to date enough and engaging with plenty of hands on. Not only that, but otherwise I would just spend weeks trying to find the perfect course when ultimately I could just get stuck in and learn!
So here I am, 4 videos in. I have learned about variables, constants, operators, types and written some basic bits of code which I have to say has been enjoyable. I even found myself sitting up at the pub on a Friday night with a beer and my laptop! 

Anyway, I won't go into too much more detail since I am only just beginning. This blog is going to be primarily for myself to document my journey and perhaps serve as a bit of a portfolio as to what I have learnt. Who knows!!
In the meantime, please feel free to reach out if you have any advice for me.
